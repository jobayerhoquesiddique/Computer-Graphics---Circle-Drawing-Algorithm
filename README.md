OpenGL Program: Rendering a Smiling Cloud Using GL_TRIANGLE_FAN and GL_LINE_STRIP This OpenGL program utilizes the GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) to render a visually appealing, cartoon-style cloud with a smiling face. The graphical elements are constructed using GL_TRIANGLE_FAN for smooth, filled circles and GL_LINE_STRIP for curved line segments.
